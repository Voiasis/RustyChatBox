## RustyChatBox

### What:
RustyChatBox is a customizable VRChat Chatbox toolkit for Linux, heavily inspired by the popular [MagicChatBox](https://github.com/BoiHanny/vrcosc-magicchatbox).

### Why:
RustyChatBox was created to address the lack of widely available and decent VRChat OSCs on Linux.

### Who:
Currently, the RustyChatBox development team consists of only me, but I'm open to collaboration and contributions.

### Where:
The project is in its early stages and serves as a semi-functional proof-of-concept. Pre-built images will be released once the project is more stable. If you'd like to try it out, follow the steps below.
