## RustyChatBox
### What:
RustyChatBox is a customizable VRChat Chatbox toolkit, created for Linux made to nostly look and feel like the popular [MagicChatBox](https://github.com/BoiHanny/vrcosc-magicchatbox).

### Why:
RustyChatBox was made due to the lack of widely available and decent VRChat OSCs on Linux.

### Who:
Currently, the RustyChatBox development team consists of only yours truly, but I wouldn't mind taking on some help from others.

### Where:
I'm not planning on releasing any pre-built images until the project is in a more stable and complete state. It's still very early stages and mostly just a semi fuctional proof-of-concept, but if you want to give it a try anyways the steps are below.

## Building & Running
- Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/Voiasis/RustyChatBox.git`
- Enter directory `cd RustyChatBox`
- Build project `just build`
- Run AppImage `./RustyChatBox.AppImage`
